# Poke-Getter
A CLI tool that will get the stats of any pokemon.

## PokeApi
This program uses [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to get a Jason (json) to parse and get relavent data

## cJSON 
This program also uses [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON). A very cool C library and the only reason I am still continuing this project. I sure as heck ain't writing no JSON parser.

## Warning 
This is currently WIP and will be worked on continuly
